RELEASES (oldest to newest):
${releasesText}

Identify only changes that would break existing caller code:
- methods that were removed or renamed, or whose signature changed
- request parameters that were removed or renamed, or that lost allowed values. These are "method" changes, named after the method the parameters go to: \`V2.MoneyManagement.FinancialAddressCreateParams\` is v2.moneyManagement.financialAddresses.create, \`...ListParams\` is .list, \`...RetrieveParams\` is .retrieve
- fields on objects the SDK returns that were removed or renamed, or that became optional or nullable (callers may now read undefined or null)
Ignore additions (including new enum values), deprecations-without-removal, docs, internal changes, and type changes that don't break reading a field (a field becoming required, a returned enum narrowing).
Give each method and each field its own entry. When the same field changed under many parents, use one entry with * for the part that varies: \`igic\` removed on \`Tax.Registration.country_options.at\`, \`.be\`, \`.de\`... is country_options.*.igic.

Return ONLY a JSON array, no markdown fences, no extra text. Each element is one of these two shapes:
{"version": "the release tag, e.g. v18.0.0", "entry": "one-line summary, e.g. 'v18.0.0: \`charges.create\` removed. Use \`paymentIntents.create\` instead.'", "kind": "method", "methodName": "the dotted call path callers would use, e.g. charges.create"}
{"version": "the release tag", "entry": "one-line summary, e.g. 'v22.7.0: \`Mandate.payment_method_details.blik.expires_after\` removed.'", "kind": "field", "fieldPath": "the path callers read off the returned object, without the resource name, e.g. payment_method_details.blik.expires_after; write array elements as [], e.g. classifications[].credit for \`FinancialConnections.Transaction.classifications[]\` credit"}

If there are no breaking changes in any of these releases, return an empty array: []`;

CHANGELOG ENTRY (what changed in the new SDK version):
${changelogEntry}

FILE: ${affectedFilePath}
CURRENT CODE:
${affectedCode}

How to update it:
- If the change names a replacement (a renamed method, field or parameter, or another way to do the same thing), switch the code to it and keep its behavior.
- If a field just became optional or nullable, guard each read of it (optional chaining or a null check) and keep the behavior the same when it's present.
- If a method was removed with no replacement, don't invent one. Calling it now throws an obscure "is not a function" error, so replace the call with a throw of an Error whose message says what was removed and in which version, and put a comment directly above it that starts with "${REVIEW_MARKER}:".
- If a field was removed with no replacement, don't swap its read for a hard-coded value (such as setting it to null or returning null): the read still runs (it gives undefined), and faking the value hides that the data is gone. Leave the code as it is and add a comment directly above the affected line that starts with "${REVIEW_MARKER}:", names what was removed and in which version, and says what this code can no longer do.
- Either way, a person will decide what to do about it.
- Change only what this breaking change requires, and leave the rest of the file exactly as it is.

Return ONLY a JSON object with this exact shape, no markdown fences, no extra text:
{"explanation": "one sentence on what you changed and why; if you only added a TODO for review, say so", "patchedCode": "the full updated file contents"}`;
